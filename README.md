## Arm Line Follower

This project uses the FRDM board to trace simple lines. 
Each wheel has its own line sensor. This project requires a line 
for each sensor to follow. Once both sensors stop sensing a line,
the motor is stopped.
 
This should be tested with a black line on a white background. The
sensors used are not perfect, so the closer to white that's detected, 
generally the further the sensor is from the desired line.
